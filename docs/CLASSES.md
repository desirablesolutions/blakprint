<h2>üìÅClasses</h2>

> our enumeration of module classes. These help organize the library with a hierarchical meta-structure to capture broad computational quanta without arbituary opinionation. 


<h3>Models</h3>

> concerned with data or code that manipulate Memory Space at any point of the lifetime of the process. This includes configurations, routes, types used to define business-declarative logic relationships, etc. 


<h4>Data</h4>

> Universal class. concerned with small to large modules of data to be efficiently loaded in M-E space.


<h5>Database</h5>

> concerned with connections to abstracted, persistable, data-stores. 

<h5>Pages</h5>

> Concerned with pages routing data, sources, methods, etc. 


<h5>Routes</h5>

> Concerned with application routing directives, policies, rules, methods, etc. 


<h4>Typings</h4>

> Universal class. concerned with small to large modules of data to be efficiently loaded in M-E space.


<h4>Configs</h4>

> Universal class. concerned with small to large modules of data to be efficiently loaded in M-E space.


<h3>Views</h3> 

> Concerened with client or programmer user-interface & experience.


<h4>Component</h4>
> concerned with functions or data that render onto a medium. Typically demands supply a render Effector but is also optional. 


<h4>Includes</h4>

> Concerned with macro-elements. Think widgets. 

<h4>Layout</h4>

> Concerned with container components & includes. 


<h4>Styles</h4>

> Universal class. Concerned with stlizer types and systems.


<h4>Libraries</h4>

> Universal class. concerned with small to large modules of data to be efficiently loaded in M-E space.


<h3>Controllers</h3>

> Concerned with mutating M-E space through abstraction.


<h4>Hooks</h4>

> Concerned with side effects & mutations triggered by time, agent or user. 

<h4>Services</h4>

> Concerned with small-to-large Facade-like interfaces and their orchestration.


<h4>Libraries</h4>

> Universal class. Concerned with small to large modules of data to be efficiently loaded in M-E space.


<h4>Utilities</h4>

> Universal class. Concerned with general helper functions to optimize computations.
